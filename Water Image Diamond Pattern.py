The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must print 2Â°N lines of output based on the following conditions.

- In the first line, the program must print N-1 asterisks without any space. Then the program must print the integer 1.
- In the second line, the program must print N-2 asterisks without any space. Then the program must print the integers 2 and 3 separated by a space in reverse order.
- In the third line, the program must print N-3 asterisks without any space. Then the program must print the integers 4, 5 and 6 separated by a space in reverse order. Similarly, the program must print the lines 
  till the Nth line.
- After printing the Nth line, the program must print the exact water image of the first N lines as the output.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
Output:
**1
*3 2
6 5 4
6 5 4
*3 2
**1
Explanation:
Here N = 3, so the pattern contains 6 lines of output. The first 3 lines are given below.
**1
*3 2
6 5 4
After printing the first 3 lines, the water image of the above 3 lines is printed.
6 5 4
*3 2
**1
Hence the output is
**1
*3 2
6 5 4
6 5 4
*3 2
**1

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4
Output:
***1 
**3 2
*6 5 4
10 9 8 7
10 9 8 7
*6 5 4
**3 2
***1
