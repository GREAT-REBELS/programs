Mr.X and his friend Mr.Y are playing a game guessing letters. Mr.X writes down the name N secretly without revealing it to Mr.Y and conveys the number of letters in the name N to his friend Y. Mr.Y tries to 
accurately guess the letters in N and comes up with a name G. The program must accept N and G as the input. The program  must print how many letters were guessed right (exactly in the same position) and how many 
letters were guessed in the incorrect position(s).
Note: The length of N and G are always equal. 

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
