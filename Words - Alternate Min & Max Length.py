The program must accept a string S containing multiple words as the input. The program must print the word which has the minimum length among the first word and the last word in S. Then the program must print the
word which has the maximum length among the second word and the last but one word in S. Similarly, the program must print the remaining words alternatively. If the lengths of the two words are equal in comparison,
then the program must print them in the order of their occurrence.
Note: The string S always contains an even number of words.
